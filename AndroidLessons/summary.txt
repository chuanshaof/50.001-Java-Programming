LESSON 1:
	45: 	XML introduction
			- layout_gravity for center of layout
			- gravity for center of widget

	51:	Inner & Nested class
			- See 52 for details

	53:	Nested Interface & Anonymous Class
			- Nested Interface
				- Static inner class = declared on class level to use multiple times
				- Anonymous class = only used once & defined when function is called

	57:	How to use basic android from AppCompatActivity
			- 63: 3 methods for onClickListener



LESSON 2:
	79:	How to use BigDecimal class

	81: 	res/values folders + Android manifest	
	
	84:	Exceptions and throwing

	85: 	Static Factory Method (Tea & teh example)
			- A static method that returns instance of the class

	86: 	Toasts

	87: 	Logcat

	88:	Explicit Intents
			- How to put extras and get extras

	90: 	Activity Lifecycle

	92: 	SharedPreferences & onPause

	93: 	Options menu

	94: 	Builder Design Pattern
			- Basically set, set, then build, will return the parent class with objects set
			- Not sure why this is even used

	96: 	URI (Universal Resource Indicators)
	
	97: 	Implicit Intents
			- How to use maps etc
			- Don't forget to change the manifest

	99: 	Unit Testing
			- Use @Test and assertEquals
	



LESSON 3:
	115: Abstract Classes
	
	117: Template Method Design Pattern
			- One abstract class to enforce methods to be implemented in other classes
			- e.g. Drink = abstract class, all other drinks have to follow it

	119:	Generic Classes & Interfaces
			- ArrayList is a generic CLASS
			- Comparable<T> is a generic INTERFACE
			
	121: 	Executor + Handlers
			- Can only access final/immutables
	
	123:	Generic Class
			- Container<T>, CHECK CODE
			- Container MUST be final to be used in executor

	
	124: Looper & Handler
			- Get a handler based on the looper


	

LESSON 4:
	137:	Recap on 2 & 3

	142:	startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE)

		setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, returnIntent) --> May be CANCELED if user backed out
		finish()

		onActivityResult

	147:	Strategy Design Pattern
			- Setting interfaces that have been implemented as the inputs
			- public void setInterface(Interface interface) { this.interface = interface; }

		Overview:
			- Delegation = parts of behaviour is handed over
				- flying behaviour delegated to FlyBehaviour
				- FlyBehaviour is an interface that forces some method

			- MallardDuck = subclassing abstract class Duck
				- We use delegation and setFlyBehaviour,etc

	151:	Adapter Design Pattern
			- Client to loop through all objects and make them do something
			- Used for recycler view
			- Make classes compatible so that the client loop still works

		Overview:
			- MallardDuck implements INTERFACE Duck & overrides
			- Adapter design pattern uses Ducks as the object type, so that many
				other types of duck can be used for the same loop

	156: 	RecyclerView
			- Use .notifyDataSetChanged() to update the view

			- Strategy Design Pattern
				- Retrieving data by RecyclerView.Adapter
				- Managing layout by LinearLayoutManager
					- recyclerView is like MallardDuck and adapter/layoutManager is like FlyBehaviour

			- Adapter Design Pattern				
				- RecyclerView.Adapter<VH> is like Duck, but is an ABSTRACT class that forces the use of
					- onCreateViewHolder
						- Called on run-time each time data is added & returns an updated <VH>
					- onBindViewHolder
						- Get data & attach them to charaViewHolder accordingly
					- getItemCount
						- Simply return number of items to be seen
					
					- Generally, <VH> is usually defined as a static inner class
						<VH> is an abstract class with no abstract methods

	162:	Make RecyclerView items responds to clicks
			- Option 2 is used in the code
			- Option 1 is commented out

	163:	itemTouchHelper
			- Meant for swiping 

	171: 	Relationship for all classes
